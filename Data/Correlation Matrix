Correlation Matrix 

In this section, we perform a thorough examination of our dataset by calculating key summary statistics such as the mean, median, mode, and variance for all relevant numeric variables. This step allows us to understand the central tendencies, variability, and distribution of the data.

Frequency Counts and Unique Counts
We also counted the number of unique fighters, countries, and other categorical variables to get a sense of the diversity in our dataset. For example, there are 128 unique fighters from 36 different countries, with the USA and Brazil being the most represented. Such insights are crucial for understanding the scope and representativeness of the dataset.


Interpreting the Correlation Matrix
One of the most powerful tools in this section is the correlation matrix, which shows the relationships between different variables. For instance, we observed a strong positive correlation between Height and Reach, which is expected since taller fighters generally have a longer reach.

10 Key Takeaways from the Correlation Matrix:
Strong Positive Correlation Between Height and Reach (0.93):

Why It Matters: This correlation indicates that taller fighters generally have a longer reach. This relationship is essential when analyzing striking and defensive metrics, where reach plays a significant role. It can also be a critical factor in predicting fight outcomes.
Moderate Negative Correlation Between Weight and Rounds Fought (-0.12):

Why It Matters: This suggests that heavier fighters tend to participate in fewer rounds. This could be due to higher knockout power, resulting in quicker finishes. This insight may guide strategies for fighters in heavier weight classes.
High Positive Correlation Between Rounds and Total Fight Time (0.98):

Why It Matters: This strong correlation is expected as more rounds result in a longer total fight time. This is crucial when evaluating fighter endurance, stamina, and strategies for longer bouts.
Moderate Negative Correlation Between KO/TKO and Time Seconds (-0.56):

Why It Matters: This suggests that fights ending in KO/TKO tend to be shorter. This could imply that knockouts are more likely to occur early in the fight rather than later, providing valuable insight into fighters' striking power and their ability to finish fights early.
Moderate Positive Correlation Between Decision_Unanimous and Total Fight Time (0.62):

Why It Matters: Fights that go the distance (longer total fight times) tend to end in unanimous decisions. This highlights the endurance and control exhibited by fighters who can last the entire duration of the fight and influence judges' scoring consistently.
Moderate Negative Correlation Between KO/TKO and Decision_Unanimous (-0.55):

Why It Matters: This negative correlation suggests that fights ending in KO/TKO are less likely to be decided by a unanimous decision. This indicates that knockouts and unanimous decisions are mutually exclusive outcomes, reflecting different fight dynamics and strategies.
Moderate Positive Correlation Between Total Strikes Landed and Rounds (0.63):

Why It Matters: This suggests that fighters who engage in longer fights tend to land more strikes. This insight is crucial for understanding a fighter's striking style, output, and endurance, which can help predict their performance in future bouts.
Weak Positive Correlation Between Ground Strikes and Fight Outcome (X.Ground_Head_Strikes and Results: 0.29):

Why It Matters: This weak correlation suggests that while ground strikes contribute to fight outcomes, they are not the most decisive factor. This insight can help refine models that predict fight outcomes based on various striking metrics.
Moderate Positive Correlation Between Total Strikes Landed and Significant Strikes (0.83):

Why It Matters: Fighters who land more total strikes also tend to land more significant strikes. This could indicate a fighter's consistency and effectiveness in striking, which can be valuable in evaluating their overall striking skills.
Weak or No Correlation Between Many Striking Metrics and Fight Outcomes:

Why It Matters: Several striking metrics, such as clinch strikes or submission attempts, show weak or no significant correlation with fight outcomes. This suggests that while these metrics may have tactical importance during fights, they are not as influential in determining overall fight results.
